1. In first model i used 1000 cat images,1000 dog images for training from [0,1000)
   Then i used 200 cat images,200 dog images for validation [1000,1200) 
   Then i used 200 cat images,200 dog images for testing [1200,1400)
   I got ~47% accuracy on testing
   I got ~83% accuracy on training
   So clearly problem is of generalization of high variance or overfitting.
   I did 25 epochs on training set
   Dense layers added were
   (i)Flatten layer - Flatting out convulation output
   (ii)Dense layer 10 units relu
   (iii)Dense layer 5 units relu
   (iv)Dense layer 1 units sigmoid

2. Now in model 2 i will add dropout(0.6) after 1st dense layer(10 units)
   And batch size increased from 100 to 200
   [Everything kept same] 
   By this i got ~72% accuracy on training set
   And ~77% accuracy on training...
   So it is generalizing well and Dropout helped
   
   Now we can get more accuracy when we training with bigger amount of dataset(training set)....
   But due to computational limitation on my PC can't do that.
